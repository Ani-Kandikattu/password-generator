# Password Generator

## Description

The objective of this assignment was to create a password generator. This code would accept parameters such as uppercase and lowercase, special characters and numbers and generate a random password using these parameters. This project would be useful for generating complex passwords to use for daily life. I learned how to accept user input to modify the password content. I also learned how to generate the password and how to hard code the parameters that the users can choose from.

## Credits

The html and css files were provided by the bootcamp and the code in the script file is my own.
